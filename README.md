We see so many drives started for fundraising on many social media platforms like whatsapp, facebook, instagram stories etc. However, there is a small gap, we do donate in such drives but we don't know if the target was achieved or not, or our donation is exceeding the target amount. In such cases, some drivers get too much money and some donâ€™t even meet the 50% of the target. So, parvaaz is a donation app that fulfills this gap. In Parvaaz, anyone can come and start a drive for educational purposes like fundraising for fees, books, uniforms, educational events etc. For starting the drive, the user just has to fill a form and give important details like, drive name, target amount, account number, and a little description. Onedrive is added anyone can come and donate into the available drives and help fulfil a noble cause. Most importantly, Parvaaz shows its users the target amount as well as how far the drive is from achieving its target. Once the target amount is reached, the drive is automatically removed from the system. Thus, it helps achieve the proper distribution of donation amounts.
